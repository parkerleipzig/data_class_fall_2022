This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(rvest)
library(ggthemes)

street_lights <- read.csv("street_lights.csv") %>% 
  clean_names

median_income <- read.csv("household_income.csv") %>% 
  clean_names

street_lights %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(x=reorder(x2020_data, n), weight=n, fill = n)) +
    labs(title = "Street Light Outages Per 1,000 Residents ", 
       subtitle = "BNIA Data, 2020",
       caption = "Graphic by Parker Leipzig",
       y="Numbers of Street Lights Out",
       x="Community")
