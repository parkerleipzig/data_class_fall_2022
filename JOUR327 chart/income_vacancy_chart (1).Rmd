#Making a bubble chart to compare

#Wells comment: Parker, it took a bit to figure out. First, the income and vacancies were on totally different scales, so the graphic would look weird. I made a dual axis graphic, fixed the second legend so it scales to 100 (for the percent).
#Second, ggplot wanted continuous data to draw a line and the data frame had one value per column. So I made it into a bubble chart. 
#if you wanted to make this into a comparison of income and vacancies, you needed to deal with a dual axis graphic with two variables. 
#we can discuss later.
